Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) where players collaboratively create and tell a fantasy story. Players take on the roles of adventurers, making choices that shape the narrative and interact with a world created by a Dungeon Master (DM). The DM acts as a storyteller, referee, and narrator, describing the environment and controlling non-player characters (NPCs) and monsters.
